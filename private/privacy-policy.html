     PRIVACY POLICY

<section class="privacy-policy" id="privacy-policy">

		<h2 class="main-color">Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>Swoop Rides is dedicated to protecting your personal information and informing you about
			how we use it. This privacy policy applies to transactions and activities and data gathered
			through the Swoop Rides Platform. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may
			revise it without notice. Each time you use the Swoop Rides Platform or provide us with
			information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that
			time.</p>

		<h4 class="main-color">Data We Collect From You</h4>
		<p>
			In order to operate the Swoop Rides Platform and to provide you with information about
			products or services that may be of interest to you, we may collect “personal information” (i.e.
			information that could be used to contact you directly (without using the Swoop Rides
			Platform) such as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit card information, or
			email address) or “demographic information” (i.e. information that you submit, or that we
			collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not limited to, zip code,
			hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history
			information, and registration history information). We will also collect the contact information of
			your friends, if you choose to connect your contacts and address book information with Swoop
			Rides and your login credentials to your social network accounts, such as Facebook and
			Twitter, if you choose to connect those accounts with your Swoop Rides account. You
			represent and warrant that you have the authority to provide us with any such contact
			information. Demographic information is divided into two categories:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>“non-public information”, which consists of ride transaction information and one-onone
				communications between you and other users of the Swoop Rides Platform; and</li>
			<li>“public information”, which consists of all other demographic information.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Please note that nowhere on the Swoop Rides Platform do we knowingly collect, keep or
			maintain personal information from children under the age of 18, as we require that all users
			represent to us that they are at least 18 years old.
		</p>

		<h4 class="main-color">How We Use Personal Information</h4>
		<p>
			We use your email address and your other personal information to help us efficiently operate
			the Swoop Rides Platform, to contact you in connection with your transactions and other
			activities on the Swoop Rides Platform (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails, or
			important news that could affect your relationship with Swoop Rides), to forward trip
			information to you from other users, to forward trip information from you to other users, and to
			contact you and others to suggest potential matches. We use your contact information to find
			and connect with your friends (when instructed by you). These types of communications are
			known as “Operational Communications.” In some cases, Operational Communications may
			also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers.
			To operate the Swoop Rides Platform, including processing your transactions and supporting
			your activities on the Swoop Rides Platform, we may share your personal information with our
			agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support
			services such as email origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship
			management services, and order fulfillment. We require these entities not to use your
			information for any other purpose.
		</p>

		<p>
			By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or
			sponsored by third parties on the Swoop Rides Platform, or electing to receive
			communications (such as emails or material by mail) or electing to participate in contests,
			sweepstakes or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored
			by third parties on the Swoop Rides Platform, you consent to our providing your personal
			information to those third parties. Those third parties may use your personal information in
			accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to
			instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by
			them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted
			to such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other
			information you submit to us.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any third party with whom we are allowed to share your personal information is authorized to
			use your personal information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third
			parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control, and
			you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who
			contact you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of
			your personal information by them.
		</p>

		<h4 class="main-color">How We Use Demographic Data</h4>
		<p>
			We may review all demographic data. We may use public information to enable other users to
			search your profile, to determine whether your trip details fit other user's requirements, and to
			communicate with you. We may use demographic information to tailor the Swoop Rides
			Platform and communications to your interests. We may also share demographic information
			with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers
			your identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that our
			advertisers' goods and services will appeal to you as a user of the Swoop Rides Platform. Our
			sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell
			advertisers which particular Swoop Rides Users are members of which demographic groups),
			subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we
			ask you to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to
			give the advertiser your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as
			being a member of that demographic group.
		</p>

		<h4 class="main-color">How to Edit Your Information</h4>
		<p>
			Swoop Rides provides you with the ability to access and edit your personal information. To
			update your personal info, click Settings in the Swoop Rides menu. There you can view,
			update and correct your account information.
		</p>
		<p>
			So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces of information,
			such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our databases automatically update any personal information you edit in your profile, or that
			you request we edit. Information transmitted through boards, chats, polls or through any other
			means remain in our databases and become the property of Swoop Rides upon submission.
			Keep this in mind if you decide to communicate personal information through any of these
			applications.
		</p>

		<h4 class="main-color">Information Retention</h4>
		<p>
			To preserve the integrity of our databases, standard procedure calls for us to retain information
			submitted by members for an indefinite length of time. Swoop Rides understands your
			submissions as consent to store all your information in one place for this indefinite length of
			time, if we so wish. If required by law, as is the case to comply with the Children's Online
			Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will nullify member information by erasing it from our
			database. We will also respond to written member requests to nullify account information.
			Also, by using the Swoop Rides Platform, you do hereby represent and warrant that you
			understand and agree that all information submitted by you through the Swoop Rides Platform
			or otherwise to Swoop Rides becomes the property of Swoop Rides and may be used in the
			sole discretion of Swoop Rides in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.
		</p>

		<h4 class="main-color">Choice/Opt-Out</h4>
		<p>
			Swoop Rides provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us
			and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor. Swoop Rides
			gives users the option to remove their information from our database, to not receive future
			communications or to no longer receive our service.
		</p>

		<h4 class="main-color">Special Cases in Which We Share Personal Information</h4>
		<p>
			Your personal information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of
			ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy. We may also disclose personal information when we
			determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with
			law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of Swoop Rides or other visitors to the
			Swoop Rides Platform. We also may disclose your personal information to our subsidiary and
			parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom
			we are under common corporate control. Whenever personal information is disclosed under
			this paragraph, we may also disclose your demographic information along with it, on a nonanonymous
			basis. All of our parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that
			receive your personal information or non-anonymous demographic information from us will
			comply with the terms of this privacy policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such
			information.
		</p>

		<h4 class="main-color">Our Security Precautions</h4>
		<p>
			Your Swoop Rides Profile is password-protected so that only you and authorized Swoop Rides
			employees have access to your account information. If you have registered for Swoop Rides
			using Facebook Connect, then your login and password shall be the same as your Facebook
			login and password. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone.
			Swoop Rides staff will never proactively reach out to you and ask for any personal account
			information, including your password. If you share a computer, you should sign out of your
			Swoop Rides account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will
			help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.
			Swoop Rides makes every effort to ensure that your information is secure on its system.
			Swoop Rides has staff dedicated to maintaining our privacy policy as set forth herein and other
			privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing web security and making sure that every Swoop Rides
			employee is aware of our security practices. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
			Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Swoop Rides cannot guarantee the
			security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. If you have any
			further questions on this issue, refer to Swoop Rides Terms of Use. Swoop Rides expressly
			disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the information you
			submit to the Swoop Rides Platform.
		</p>

		<p>
			Swoop Rides has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration
			of the information under our control. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on
			computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other
			governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these
			computer networks are located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in your
			country or jurisdiction.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Swoop Rides Platform may contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the
			privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the
			Swoop Rides Platform to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects
			personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by
			the Swoop Rides Platform.
		</p>

		<h4 class="main-color">Changing Our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information</h4>
		<p>
			If at any point we decide to use particular personally identifiable information in a manner
			materially different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of
			an email or by providing 30 days notice on the Swoop Rides Platform. We also encourage you
			to review this privacy policy periodically. By using the Swoop Rides Platform, you do hereby
			represent and warrant that you have read, understand and agree to all terms of Agreement.
			Each time you use the Swoop Rides Platform, you agree to all terms set forth in this Agreement
			and any other policies published by Swoop Rides on the Swoop Rides Platform. Please note
			that we will continue to have the right to change our privacy policy and practices, and how we
			use your personally identifiable information, without notice, as described in herein, provided
			that such changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the change.
		</p>
