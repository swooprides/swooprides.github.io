### Ridesharing

Every day trusted people from your social and professional networks live, work, and play along similar routes and attend the same events, and Swoop makes is easy for you to discover each other and travel there together.
Have you wondered who the other people are in the cars around you while sitting in traffic every morning on the way to work? What if we tell you that 75% of the morning commuters are within three degrees of separation, and most of them have very interesting jobs, experiences, and stories to tell, just like you do. How cool would it be to be part of a social network on wheels where you get to share rides with and befriend the people who are in your shoes every single morning. Swoop turns your car into an opportunity to expand your professional network, make new friends, and share the cost of your commute.
Are you surprised to discover that many of the attendees of your favorite MeetUp, sports event, weekend soccer practice, or concert in town are friends of your friends, live nearby, or travelled alone to the event just like you did? Wouldn’t it be fun and rewarding to share the ride next time, make friends, and share stories on the way? Swoop allows you to form social carpools on the way to events with the click of a button, and meet fellows with the same interests as yours.
What about your weekend? How many times have you wanted to go to the beach, go hiking, run an errand, or escape the city for a few hours, but you don’t have a car, or don’t have anyone in mind with whom to do it? Swoop shows you where your network is going so you can always find a friend to go with or jump on a last minute spontaneous trip.
